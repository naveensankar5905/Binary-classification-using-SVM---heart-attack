# Heart Disease Classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM)
This project demonstrates a classification task on the Heart Disease dataset using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel. The aim is to predict whether a patient has heart disease based on various medical attributes.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is heart.csv. The target variable is output, which indicates the presence of heart disease (1 for presence, 0 for absence). The dataset is split into features (X) and the target label (y).

Model Training
Model Used: Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Kernel: Radial Basis Function (RBF)
C: 20.62
Gamma: 0.01
Degree: 3 (default for RBF kernel)
The model is trained on 80% of the dataset and tested on the remaining 20%.

Results
Accuracy
Train Accuracy: 100.0000 %
Test Accuracy: 97.0732 %
